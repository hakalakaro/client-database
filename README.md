Customer Information Management System

This is a simple PHP script that allows you to add customer information into a database. The script takes input from a form and inserts the data into a MySQL database table called "asiakastaulu". The form fields include first name, last name, email, address, postal code and city.

The script is designed to be easy to use and understand. It uses the mysqli extension to connect to the database and PDO is not used.

Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have a web server with PHP and MySQL installed. You will also need to create a database and a table called "asiakastaulu" with fields as per the form fields.

You can then upload the PHP script to your web server and access it through a web browser. The form will be displayed and you can enter customer information and submit the form. The data will be inserted into the database table.

Please note that you will need to update the connection variables in the script to match your database setup.
